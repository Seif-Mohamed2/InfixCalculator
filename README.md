# InfixCalculator

<h2> Introduction </h2>

InfixCalculator is a calculator that takes a string input of a mathematical operation. Then ouput the results taking precedence of operators in consideration. In other words, the program would evaluate 4 + 3 * 2 to be 10 rather than 14. The program also tells you if the experession entered in not valid such as 2 + + 2

<h2>Files in the program</h2>
I created my own data structure for stack and queue to be simple and with some additional methods to help debugging. The data structure files are:<br>
Node.java: Node object used in both queue and stack<br>
Linkedlist.java: simple linkedlist implementation<br>
myQueue: simple queue implementation <br>
myStack: simple stack implementation <br>
<strong>InfixCalculator </strong>: contain main algorithm and functions <br>
<h2>Simple explanation </h2>

The program uses stacks and queues to verify which operators are going to be performed first. The algorithm is divided into two stages: <br>
<strong>1- arranging the input into queue using the precedence of operands<br>
  2- evaluating the generated queue.</strong>
  <br><br>
 Arranging the input into the queue is done using a stack of  operators. When an operator is found in the input itâ€™s either directly added to the stack or we first remove all elements on top of the stack with higher precedence to this operator and add them to the queue. <i><strong>This operation takes place in the main function</i></strong>

<br>
Evaluating the queue takes place in postEval function defined in infixcalculator. The function takes the operator in the queue and its operand/s then evaluates it and adds it to the final result. <br>
